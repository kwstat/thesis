Multinomial example from DLR
First the scalar case.  Input parameter: p
Enter a number greater than 1 to exit scalar case.
Enter pi(0):  .5
Epsilon:    1e-07
Initial pi: 0.5
Iter     pi           x2       
1   0.608247   25

4   0.626777   29.8159
5   0.626816   29.8263
6   0.626821   29.8277
7   0.626821   29.8279
8   0.626821   29.8279
Converges when |PrevPi-Pi| < Eps.
Enter a number greater than 1 to exit scalar case.
Enter pi(0):  2
